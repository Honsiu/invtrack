# InvTrack Admin Dashboard

## Developing

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Notifications

We're setting up a service worker with OneSignal - it's crucial that the file path and names are not modified - refer to the svelte docs for an exaplanation.
To test notifications, build the web app and send a new notification in the local OneSignal testing project.
